Humans have been in constant migration throughout our history. Nowadays, the majority of people in transit are so out of necessity. See for example _[Exodus](https://publicdelivery.org/sebastiao-salgado-exodus/)_ of Photographer Sebasti√£o Salgado. 

We dream of a world in which people are and feel welcome everywhere they go, regardless if they migrate out of choice or necessity. 

With the current refugee crisis in Europe, we have seen an incredible response from communities, organisations and governments. Despite the horrors of war, there is hope. However, we have also seen shortcomings and blind spots, especially when trying to solve human problems at scale. It is easy to overlook those most vulnerable, or it is easy to assume people only need shelter, but not a community, mastery or purpose.

In this project, we aim to tackle some of those shortcomings by communicating both with the people in need and those providing support. Ideally, we can provide a hub for information exchange and community building that serves this refugee crisis and others to come. But we are also ready to challenge our hypothesis, to invest our efforts where we hear is more needed, to step back and listen.

Welcome. If you have information, ideas, feedback, or needs please reach out. Let us take a step towards the world we all dream of.
